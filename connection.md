# Connection
{: .no_toc }

We will work on a virtual platform, which is a copy of an Alliance computing system. This way, we don't need to have an Alliance account.
Connect using your username.

```shell
ssh username@ulcip.calculquebec.cloud
```

# Change your current directory to your user directory 

```shell
cd projects/def-sponsor00/user{id}/
```
